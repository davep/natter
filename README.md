# Natter

A wee experimental terminal-based chat client, built to mess around with the
[Python Ollama library](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python).

## Motivation

There are lots of good and very comprehensive terminal-based LLM clients out
there. Pretty much all of them are feature-rich and very busy, and most
concentrate on privacy-problematic backend engines.

I wanted to toy with something that was simple, direct, to the point, and
locally-based.

Also, this is a tinker toy so I can experiment with the library I've built
this around, and also experiment with how I can make use of a locally-hosted
LLM.
